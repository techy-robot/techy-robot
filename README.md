## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am absolutely a nerd who loves talking about my passion. I look like a normal human being, until I finally start talking and it all comes pouring out. Since I was a preschooler, I have been curious about engineering, often crafting advanced paper creations and playing with LEGOs and trains. I have always been imaginative, filling multiple journals with hundreds of invention concepts. Being an engineer helps turn those fictitious ideas into real physical works of magic.

I am interested in Mechanical and Electrical engineering, and hope to get a degree in Mechatronics or Robotics.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CACKLE
